										<p style="text-align:justify; ">I opted for an internship in Awesome CX primarily due to the abundant opportunities it offers in roles like IT support, system administration, inventory management, and technical jobs involving hardware configuration for laptops and PCs. These roles not only resonate with my career interests but also provide a diverse and hands-on experience in crucial aspects of information technology. By immersing myself in these areas, I aim to gain practical skills and knowledge that are directly applicable to real-world scenarios, preparing me for a successful and fulfilling career journey in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.</p>
										<p style="text-align:justify; ">Joining Awesome CX in my internship with exceptional supervisors has been a game-changer for me. From the moment I stepped in, these supervisors have gone above and beyond, not just guiding me but also teaching me every skill necessary for the job. Their dedication to nurturing talent is evident in the comprehensive training sessions they conduct, covering technical expertise as well as essential soft skills. What sets them apart is their willingness to offer personalized support, whether it's through one-on-one coaching sessions, tailored development plans, or simply being there to address any queries or challenges I encounter. </p>
										<blockquote class="overlay">
											<p>On-the-job training (OJT) is vital for IT students like me as it provides hands-on experience, bridging the gap between theory and practice. Under the guidance of experienced professionals, I gain practical skills, exposure to industry standards, and valuable networking opportunities, preparing me for a successful career in IT.</p>

Adaptability and flexibility are essential in navigating the dynamic IT environments within the company as it helps me to become more nimble of the things that i do, and should not do knowing that this things continually change. Being a team player fosters collaboration and synergy within other interns, in terms of doing tasks together since most of the job that was assigned to us was group tasks rather than individual tasks.</p>

My self-confidence shines when I present solutions or ideas during group tasks or agent interactions. Possessing appropriate social skills is evident in my effective communication with fellow interns, supervisors and agents. I demonstrate adaptability and flexibility by swiftly adjusting to changes in immediate task transfer or time shifting. As a team player, I collaborate with fellow interns on troubleshooting issues or brainstorming solutions on how to finish given tasks fast.

											<h2>Describe scenarios/situations and problems encountered during my work and how did i handle them?</h2>
											<p style="text-align:justify; ">As i have the most important tasks during our internship, Inventory and audit was not an easy tasks, you need to track every equipment that comes in and goes out from the storage, memorise all equipment listed in the storage, track transferred equipments, where is it deployed and determine which equipment is defective. Now at first i had many mistakes but i asked our senior for guidance and lucky enough he helped me with this said tasks until i was good enough to do it on my own.</p>

These values have not only shaped my professional growth but also instilled in me the importance of accountability, flexibility, honesty, and collaboration, which I believe are indispensable traits for success as a future IT professional.</p>

											<h2>Will you become a good and competent IT professional someday? Why?</h2>
